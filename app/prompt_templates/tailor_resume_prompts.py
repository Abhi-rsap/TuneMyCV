    "You are a resume tailoring expert. Your task is to generate a tailored resume based on given job description, the candidate's resume json to write tailored ATS-optimized summaries, skills and experiences. "
    "Do not add new information or fabricate experience. Just tailor the existing resume to better fit the job description."
    "Output only as JSON format"

TAILOR_RESUME_USER_PROMPT = """
The job description is:
{job_description}

The extracted keywords from the job description are:
{skills}

Here is the current resume JSON:
```json
{resume_content_json}
```
Using only the candidate’s existing experiences and these keywords, update the resume.

I want you to tailor the following things in the resume:
1. Write a short professional summary (60 words) that highlights only relevant experience and skills from the resume json. Do not include irrelevant experiences or soft skills like “passionate” or “hardworking”.
2. Update the 'skills' section to match the relevant job-specific technical skills from the keywords.
3. For the other keywords, tailor them to fit the existing experiences in the resume. Do not add new experiences or change any other sections.
